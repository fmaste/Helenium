An EDSL for Selenium in Haskell!

Tired of having to test before and after every release at work, I build my own domain specific language embedded in Haskell. 
Here's how it looks like, an example that searches "google" in Google an does some extra stuff

    goTo "http://www.google.com/ncr"
    searchInput <- getElementById "lst-ib"
    sendKeysToElement searchInput "google"
    sleep 5
    takeScreenshot
    assertElementDoesNotExistsById "UNKNOWN-DOM-NODE"
    echo "About to finish."
    refresh
    assertElementDoesNotExistsByXPath "/html/body/div"
    return ()

I also build a web based console for the team to create, edit and run the tests with just a a web browser while providing a nice output of the whole run (screeshots, debug, assertions, warnings, etc).
